# Survey-Distributed-Machine-Learning
This is a bibliography survey upon Distributed Machine Learning. The survey contains algorithmic selections and architectures that can facilitate distributed learning on ML models. There is also a part that presents MLlib, a ML library from Apache Spark for distributed ML implementations.

# Abstract
Distributed Machine Learning is the idea of training machine learning models
across multiple devices, rather than on a single machine. This technique is
particularly useful for training models that generalise from a very big number of
data, such as SVMs and Neural networks. Distributed ML allows faster and more-
efficient training of these models. However, the distribution of data and
computational load brings new challenges such as communication overhead, data
inconsistency and fault tolerance. Companies have been attempting to address
these issues by developing new frameworks and modifying distributed system
technologies already in use. In this survey study, we will go over the existing issues
with distributed training in more detail before examining some of the ideas that have
been proposed to deal with the above problems.
